"""Provider runway adapters (DESIGN §12).

One adapter per provider, each returning the same ``Runway`` record. Four
read a remote endpoint, two read CLI-owned local state.

Credential handling: a key comes from OpenCode's own credential store,
``~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json``, falling back to a named environment
variable. It is read inside the adapter, used for one request, and never
returned, stored, printed, or logged. ``raw`` is assembled from named fields
and then scrubbed, so no response body (which may echo a key) reaches the
database or the screen. ``api_key`` returns the value and a SOURCE LABEL;
only the label is ever safe to show.

Failure model: every adapter fails soft. Unreachable, unauthorized, garbage
JSON, or a local file whose shape drifted all yield a ``Runway`` with
``remaining=None`` and a ``reason``. Adapters never raise (DESIGN §12:
unknown runway means the provider is available and marked unknown; dispatch
never blocks on a failed scraper).

Windows, not providers, are the unit of a reading: a provider is
ONE record carrying EVERY window it reports, because a 5-hour limit and a
weekly limit are two facts about one plan. There is no ``limit`` on a
window — every window is a percentage of itself, so a limit is
always 100 and says nothing.

Staleness survives only where it changes meaning: a reading whose window has
already reset is history, and says so. The age remains machine-readable so
clients do not act on old numbers, without cluttering the normal display.

Two provider kinds exist. A ``plan`` provider (Claude, Codex, Kimi,
MiniMax, Grok) is a subscription: it shows consumption against its windows
and never a price. Only an ``api`` provider (DeepSeek, anything billed per
token) shows money — DeepSeek's account balance is the point of its card.

A plan may still bank something spendable: Codex and Grok
both hold usage RESETS, which are not money and belong on a plan's card.
Adapters put their scrubbed display text plus any known count and expiry in
``raw["credits"]``; public projections whitelist only those three fields.
